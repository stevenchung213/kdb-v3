  <p><strong>REDD strategies to reverse deforestation and degradation developed or planned:</strong></p>
  <p><strong><br/></strong></p>
  <p>As part of its State System of Incentives for Environmental Services (SISA), Acre is developing a Program of Incentives for Environmental Services-Carbon (IES-Carbon Program). The program is designed to include the entire state territory, incorporating regional and thematic sub-programs as well as special REDD+ projects based on a nested approach. The subprograms are intended to define the specific guidelines for REDD+ activities in a given region, while the purpose of the thematic subprograms is to provide REDD+ actions for certain groups of environmental service providers, e.g. indigenous territories and protected areas, according to the priorities identified by the government. Special REDD+ projects are associated to private REDD+ activities.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The IES-Carbon Program is comprised of 2 main sets of interventions: (1) direct assistance and regulatory actions such as technical extension, community organization, fire control, and improvement of monitoring and control mechanisms, and (2) incentives for environmental services directed to improving the productivity of deforested areas as well as to promote sustainable use of forests and protection of forests for stakeholders such as indigenous peoples, extractivist families, and small, medium and large rural producers. The program is managed by the organizations that comprise the SISA: (1) the state commission for validation and monitoring (CEVA), comprised of civil society and government members in equal numbers; (2) Climate Change and Environmental Service Regulation Institute (IMC), a government agency for the regulation, monitoring, control and registry of environmental assets such as carbon; (3) the Environmental Services Development Company, a semi public corporation in charge of raising funds and implementing actions under the SISA and the IES Carbon Program; 4) the Scientific Committee &ndash; comprised of nationally and internationally renowned figures in several fields of science, reports into the IMC and provides opinions on technical, scientific, legal and methodological issues related to the SISA; and 5) Ombudsman, under the Environment Secretariat, as a mechanism for conflict resolution and ongoing improvement of the system. &nbsp;</p></div>
