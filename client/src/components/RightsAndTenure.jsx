  <div><p><strong>Land/forest tenure administration and relation with REDD</strong><br/><br/><strong>1. Legal support and protection of forest tenure</strong><br/><br/>In federal areas such as Extractive Reserves (Resex), the Interministerial Decree No. 13(published on September 19, 2002) aimed to recognize the traditional populations in Resex, as recipients of the National Plan for Agrarian Reform - PNRA, following the operational procedures adopted by INCRA and IBAMA. Based on Norm #40 of March 30, 2004, residents of Resex were declared as beneficiaries of agrarian reform, with full rights to credits designated to any household family in a Settlement Project.<br/><br/>The Land Institute of Acre - ITERACRE, created by Law #1373 of 04 March 2001, is the agency responsible for agrarian policy in the State, land tenure regulation and zoning, development of the State&rsquo;s Land Registry, and mediation of conflicts over land ownership in areas under the State's jurisdiction.<br/><br/>Forest management in Acre is regulated by Law #1426 (December 27, 2001) known as the Forest Law. Currently, the Federal Law #11284 of March 2, 2006 (Forest Management Act) and the State Forest Law authorize Forest Concessions, with the obligation to draw up an Annual Forest Concession Plan - PAOF. The main objective of the Acre PAOF in 2009 was to make two state forests available for concessions. The communities living in state forests had their land rights recognized and a title for usufruct was granted to these communities.<br/><br/>Regarding Indigenous People&rsquo;s rights to land, the Brazilian Constitution defines the rights of indigenous peoples to their lands as a right acquired prior to the existence of the Brazilian State and also ensures respect for their social organization, customs, languages, beliefs and traditions.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>2. Clear responsibilities, capacity and authority for forest tenure administration</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Considering that most of Acre&rsquo;s territory is located in range of the Peruvian and Bolivian borders, which corresponds to 150 km in width along the entire land border of Brazil, and is thus under federal authority, only 14.6% of the land is under Acre State&rsquo;s jurisdiction (ITERACRE). In the nearly 85% of the territory jurisdiction, INCRA (National Agrarian Reform Institute) is responsible for land tenure regulation.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>FUNAI is a federal body under the Ministry of Justice responsible for public policies involving indigenous peoples, and its primary purpose is to promote sustainable development policies for indigenous peoples; control and mitigate potential environmental impacts from external interference with indigenous lands; monitor legalized indigenous lands and those inhabited by indigenous peoples, including isolated and recently contacted populations; coordinate and implement policies for the protection of isolated and newly contacted tribes; and implement surveillance, enforcement and conflict prevention actions in indigenous lands in order to protect and promote the rights of indigenous peoples.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>3. Actions planned or developed by governments to solve issues related to land tenure uncertainties within REDD priority areas</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Following the agreement between the State Government and National Agrarian Reform Institute (Incra) in 2008, the relationship of state environmental and territorial agencies has been evolving with the regional INCRA office in Acre into a more effective collaboration for regulation of settlement projects. The cooperation has strengthened the development of management plans for these areas and enabled easier access to credit for members of the settlement communities.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The federal Ministry for Agrarian Development and the government of Acre announced an agreement of $13.5 million from the Legal Land Program for activities related to regulation of land tenure on rural properties in the state of Acre and public areas located along the BR-364 highway between Sena Madureira and Cruzeiro do Sul.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Environmental Licensing of Rural Properties System (MLAPR) within the Environment Institute of Acre (IMAC) is a rural environmental registry that can be used as a tool for land tenure regulation. The Sustainable Rural Property Certification Project is managed by the Agroforestry Extension and Family Based Farming Secretariat, which provides incentives to adopt more sustainable production practices (including eliminating the use of fire and deforestation), is also intended to assist farmers in achieving compliance with environmental regulations. Through this project, small household farmers make a multi-year land use plans for their properties on a voluntary basis, receiving technical assistance and an annual incentive called a bonus. The bonus is a monetary incentive as an allowance to support implementation of pluriannual plans.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>4. Relationship between forest tenure resolution and REDD objectives/actions</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>5. Recognition of communities and indigenous peoples&rsquo; rights</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The State of Acre has advanced with respect to land tenure regulation within Extractive Reserves as well as granting real right of use to residents in state lands.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>By 2009, 28 Indigenous Territories (TI) for 14 indigenous peoples with an estimated population of 12,720 individuals have been recognized in the state of Acre. Another 6 areas are in the process of being identified. Together, these areas comprise a total of 2,320,232 ha (14.1% of the state's territory).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Also, Law #2308/2010 makes eligible as beneficiaries of environmental services providers all those who conserve, preserve or restore environmental services and use natural resources sustainably, thereby acknowledging the role played by these communities in the conservation, preservation and protection of environmental services.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>6. Participation of communities and indigenous peoples in forest tenure definition</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In order to create protected areas (conservation units and indigenous territories), public consultation to define the concession of use of public land to the local population is carried out since the land title belongs to the State but right of use is ceded to inhabitants.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The National Agrarian Reform Institute (Incra) is responsible for Agrarian Land Reform Settlement Projects, which involve consultation processes and establishment of a landless families&rsquo; registry. INCRA defines a process where the concession of use is given to a household for a transitional period of time before the legal land title is authorized, depending on the performance of the settled family.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>7. Definition of legal aspects related to forest carbon ownership and rights in REDD project areas</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In 2010, Law #2308 was passed, and it establishes the System of Incentives for Environmental Services, the IES Carbon Program and other programs. This law regulates carbon emissions. &nbsp;Thus Article 25 states that &ldquo;In order to ensure the system&rsquo;s accounting stability, the Institute for Regulation, Control and Registry must establish, for the purpose of pre-registration of plans of action and ad hoc projects, a percentage limit of recordable carbon units, based on total reductions under PPCD/AC for a specific commitment period.</p>
  <p>Law #2308 is still undergoing supplementary regulations, where complementary rules requiring details on implementation of the IES Carbon Program are being defined.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>8. Conflict resolution measures in place.</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The principle instruments to address conflict related to land tenure are the State Zoning (EEZ) plan and its land use guidelines as well as the land uses defined by the State Policy Councils (Environment, Science and Technology Council, State Council for Forests, and Sustainable Forest and Rural Development Council).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Law #2308 of SISA established the State Commission for Validation and Monitoring CEVA) comprised of an equal number of members from civil society, chosen from the three state Councils mentioned above and by government officials. &nbsp;CEVA is responsible for ongoing surveillance of SISA and the IES Carbon Program. The Commission has been established and has been active since January 2012.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>9. Needs identified?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Although the environmental monitoring and licensing of rural properties (MLAPR) system is in place, land tenure on a large scale must still be resolved.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Law #2308 establishing the SISA also provides for an Ombudsman responsible for conflict resolution, but this has not yet been established.&nbsp;</p>
